Provides light-weight platform-independent logging that can output to a file just as easily as it can
an abstract on-screen "text view" control (of course backed by one that's platform-specific or custom).
Just tell it where to log, even to multiple destinations.
...even to the command line!

Finally, our definition of "logging" will probably also be extended to include a platform-independent
pop-up "alert dialog" window.  This can convey information as similarly.
