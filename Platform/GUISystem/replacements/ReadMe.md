Dear ImGui Drop-in Replacement Files
------------------------------------

As of: **dear imgui, v1.80 WIP**  
these Vulkan-specific implementation files provide the following additional capability:

	//  [X] Renderer: User texture binding. Changes of ImTextureID ARE supported by this binding! See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/pull/914
	     ↑                                                         ↑↑↑
	     These files insert the X here - and change from "aren't" this word.

That is, under Vulkan, `ImGui::Image(...)`, `ImGui::ImageButton(...)`, etc. didn't actually work.  All they did display would be the
currently loaded font atlas, which was the first (and only) image loaded.  So changing `ImTextureID` had no effect (despite what it says
here [https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1848](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1848) and here 
[https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/commit/948009a8b2e98ef35fb8ddfe19299535a16c0834](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/commit/948009a8b2e98ef35fb8ddfe19299535a16c0834)).

These files change that and provide this functionality.  Note that one bug seems to persist however, on Macs using MoltenVK, although the
image loads and appears correctly at full-size, when scaled-down using ImGui, it "fades to red" the smaller it gets.  This is perhaps due
to the particular `VkSampler` that ImGui uses internally.  We will investigate this further later.

The changes folded into these most-recent files originated from (and full credit goes to) Marcell Kiss or [https://github.com/martty](https://github.com/martty)
[https://github.com/martty/imgui/commit/f1f948bea715754ad5e83d4dd9f928aecb4ed1d3](https://github.com/martty/imgui/commit/f1f948bea715754ad5e83d4dd9f928aecb4ed1d3)

Unlike his implementation, however, I use `VkDescriptorImageInfo` to pass `VkSampler`, `VkImageView`, and `VkImageLayout` all at once.
So usage looks like this:

    TextureSpec texspec;
    texspec.filename = "image.png";
    TextureImage* pImage = new TextureImage(texspec, vulkan.command.vkPool(), vulkan.device, platform);
    ImTextureID userTextureId = ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture(pImage->getDescriptorImageInfo());

Or:

    VkDescriptorImageInfo descriptorImageInfo(sampler, imageView, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL);
    ImTextureId userTextureId = ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture(descriptorImageInfo);

Or just:

    ImTextureId userTextureId = ImGui_ImplVulkan_AddTexture( { sampler, imageView, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL } );
