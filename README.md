# VulkanModule

Codebase shared between 3D graphics projects using [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), especially to streamline its setup process in an object-oriented manner.  Please refer to the coupled repository [HelloVulkanSDL](https://github.com/electromaggot/HelloVulkanSDL) which includes this submodule in example projects for Apple (iOS and macOS) and Microsoft Windows.
