//
// DeviceQueues.h
//	Vulkan Setup Module
//
// Encapsulate the Queue Families and Queues supported
//	by a Device for "display-to-screen" capability.
// Intended to be parented/owned/instanced by GraphicsDevice.
//
// The "suitability" analysis reflects how well a given device supports both Graphics and
//	"Present" operations in its queues (i.e. sets of identical queues, or each queue family),
//	particularly for one purpose here: rendering and presenting graphics on a display device.
//
//  Put simply, we're only interested in queues supporting both Graphics and Present; those
//	return a score of 2.  Others return 0.  Obviously it's up to caller to appropriately
//	scale these values to fit into a scoring scheme amongst other criteria.
//
// Note also for simplicity, only one queue is represented here.  If, for the given family,
//	multiple queues are needed (at arbitrary priorities), that can be added in the future
//	and is left somewhat flexible here.
