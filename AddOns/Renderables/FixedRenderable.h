// Encapsulates a rendered-object's draw commands, but also its pipeline,
//	and... commandBuffer details like how often it has to re-record
// (TJ: The above seems abstract like should be in iRenderable.)
//
// A "fixed" renderable has draw commands that only have to be recorded once, as the way
//	it's drawn doesn't change.  (This excludes something like a model-view-projection
//	UBO to change its 3D object's view angle, which applies separately.)
// Therefore, the CommandBuffer is recorded at construction time.  Not per each frame,
//	which would happen in the Update() method, which here is thus empty.
