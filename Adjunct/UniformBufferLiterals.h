/* NOTE 2
	Using "vec3" seemed to lead to a variable-offset-mismatch on the GPU side!  Specifically,
	graphically at runtime, mouseX appeared to increment in time while mouseY remained 0.
	It seemed that resolution was 16 bytes here but 12 there, so the last float of the
	now-vec4 (zero) went into 'time' on the GPU, and 'time' here went into mouseX there.
	Attempting 'alignas(12)' above as corrective measure is illegal: not a power of two.
